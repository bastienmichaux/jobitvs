<summary>What is a MAC Address?</summary>

**Media Access Control Address:** A unique identifier (UID) that is assigned to a NIC. It's a 48-bit or 64-bit address, which is associated with the network adapter. MAC address can be in hexadecimal format.
</details>



<!-- $Q:C -->
<details>
<summary>What is the purpose of a MAC Address?</summary>

Important reasons for using MAC address:
- Provides a secure way to find senders or receivers in the network
- It helps you to prevent unwanted network access
- It can be used to identify and track a device
- Wi-Fi networks at the airport use the MAC address of a specific device in order to identify it
</details>



<!-- $Q:C -->
<details>
<summary>What are the types of MAC Addresses?</summary>

**UAA:** Universally Administered Address: the most used type of MAC address. It's assigned to each physical device by the manufacturer  at the time of manufacturing.

**LAA:** Locally Administered Address: an address that changes the MAC address of the adapter. Usually set by a network administrator to override the UAA.
</details>



<!-- $Q:D -->
<details>
<summary>Can two different devices have the same MAC address?</summary>

No, two NICs shouldn't have the same MAC address, as it would create conflicts and confusion on the network. However, it is possible for a MAC address to be spoofed or duplicated, such as to bypass security measures or to hide the identity of the device.
