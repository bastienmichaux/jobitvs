<summary>What are the types of MAC Addresses?</summary>

**UAA:** Universally Administered Address: the most used type of MAC address. It's assigned to each physical device by the manufacturer  at the time of manufacturing.

**LAA:** Locally Administered Address: an address that changes the MAC address of the adapter. Usually set by a network administrator to override the UAA.
