## Fundamentals

<!-- $Q:D -->
<details id="computer-parts">
<summary>What are the main parts of a computer?</summary>

A computer is made of different components:
1. **CPU: Central Processing Unit:** The "brain" of the computer. A primary component responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It can be considered as the "brain" of the computer as it processes data and coordinates tasks.
1. **RAM: Random Access Memory:** the computer's short-term memory. It provides quick access to data that the CPU needs to operate efficiently. RAM stores instructions and data during program execution. RAM serves as the computer's volatile or temporary storage. Its content is lost when the computer is powered off.
1. **Hard Drive:** also known as **SSD (Solid-State Drive)**: The non-volatile, long-term memory of the computer. This storage device retains data even when the computer is powered off. It stores the operating system, programs, and user files.
1. **Motherboard:** the primary circuit board that connects and integrates the components. It provides communication pathways for data transfer between the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and other peripherals.
1. **PSU: Power Supply Unit:** supplies the required electrical energy to all components within the computer system. The PSU converts the alternating current (AC) power from an electrical outlet into direct current (DC) power suitable for the computer's operation.
1. **Cooling System:** Computers generate heat, and overheating may damage the components or shut down the system. The cooling system prevents overheating using fans, heat sinks, and other mechanisms to dissipate heat. The CPU and GPU are the main sources of heat.
1. **I/O: Input/Output Devices:** I/O devices allow users to input data or commands into the computer and receive output or information from it. Examples include keyboards, mice, monitors, speakers, printers, and external storage devices.
1. **OS: Operating System:** a software layer that manages and controls computer hardware and software resources. It provides an interface for users to interact with the computer, manages processes, allocates system resources, and facilitates the execution of applications. All computers come with an OS, otherwise users would have to program one from scratch, which isn't as fun as it was in the 80's.

To sum it up:
1. the motherboard connects all components
1. the CPU executes instructions using data stored in RAM
1. I/O devices are necessary to enable user interactions
1. the hard drive provides non-volatile storage for long-term data

<details>
<summary>What is a GPU?</summary>

**GPU: Graphics Processing Unit:** a component specialized in graphics-related tasks. It improves visual performance and responsiveness as it handles and accelerates computations related to graphics and visual data processing. It is particularly valuable for rendering complex images, videos, and 3D graphics.

## Peripherals

<!-- $Q:C -->
<details>
<summary>What is a NIC?</summary>

**Network Interface Card:** a peripheral card that is attached to a PC in order to connect to a network. Every NIC has its own **MAC address** that identifies the PC on the network.
</details>



<!-- $Q:C -->
<details>
<summary>What is a MAC Address?</summary>

**Media Access Control Address:** A unique identifier (UID) that is assigned to a NIC. It's a 48-bit or 64-bit address, which is associated with the network adapter. MAC address can be in hexadecimal format.
</details>



<!-- $Q:C -->
<details>
<summary>What is the purpose of a MAC Address?</summary>

Important reasons for using MAC address:
- Provides a secure way to find senders or receivers in the network
- It helps you to prevent unwanted network access
- It can be used to identify and track a device
- Wi-Fi networks at the airport use the MAC address of a specific device in order to identify it
</details>



<!-- $Q:C -->
<details>
<summary>What are the types of MAC Addresses?</summary>

**UAA:** Universally Administered Address: the most used type of MAC address. It's assigned to each physical device by the manufacturer  at the time of manufacturing.

**LAA:** Locally Administered Address: an address that changes the MAC address of the adapter. Usually set by a network administrator to override the UAA.
</details>



<!-- $Q:D -->
<details>
<summary>Can two different devices have the same MAC address?</summary>

No, two NICs shouldn't have the same MAC address, as it would create conflicts and confusion on the network. However, it is possible for a MAC address to be spoofed or duplicated, such as to bypass security measures or to hide the identity of the device.
